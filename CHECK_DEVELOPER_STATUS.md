# Check Apple Developer Program Status

## Step 1: Check Developer Account Status

1. **Go to:** [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
2. **Sign in** with: `aldo400@outlook.com`
3. **Look for:**

### What You Should See:

**If Active/Processed:**
- You'll see "Apple Developer Program" (not just "Apple Developer")
- Membership status shows "Active"
- You can access all features

**If Still Processing:**
- You might see a message about enrollment in progress
- Or it might say "Pending" or "Processing"
- You might see "Apple Developer" (free) instead of "Apple Developer Program" (paid)

**If Payment Issue:**
- You might see a message about payment processing
- Or incomplete enrollment

## Step 2: Check Email

Check your email (`aldo400@outlook.com`) for:
- Confirmation email from Apple about Developer Program enrollment
- Payment receipt
- Any emails about account activation

## Step 3: Typical Timeline

- **Payment processed:** Usually immediate (few hours)
- **Account activation:** 24-48 hours after payment
- **Xcode recognition:** Sometimes needs manual refresh after activation

## What to Do If Still Processing:

1. **Wait 24-48 hours** - This is normal for new enrollments
2. **Check email** for activation confirmation
3. **Once activated:**
   - Sign out and back into Xcode Preferences → Accounts
   - Click "Download Manual Profiles"
   - Your paid team should appear

## Can You Still Use TestFlight While Waiting?

Unfortunately, **no**. You need an active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) to:
- Upload to App Store Connect
- Use TestFlight
- Submit to the App Store

Personal Teams (free) cannot use TestFlight.
