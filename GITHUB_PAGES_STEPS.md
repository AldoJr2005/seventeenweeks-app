# GitHub Pages Setup - Quick Steps

You've created the repository! Now follow these steps:

## Step 1: Upload the Privacy Policy File

1. **Look for the "Add file" button** at the top of your repository page
   - It's usually near the green "Code" button
   - Click **"Add file"** → Select **"Upload files"** from the dropdown

2. **Upload the file:**
   - Drag and drop `privacy-policy-template.html` into the upload area
   - OR click "choose your files" to browse for it
   - File location: `/Users/aj/Downloads/PWA-Builder/privacy-policy-template.html`

3. **IMPORTANT:** After uploading, rename the file to: `index.html`
   - You'll see the filename in a text field - change it there

4. Scroll down and click the green **"Commit changes"** button
   - You can leave the commit message as is or change it to "Add privacy policy"

**Alternative:** If you can't find "Upload files", use "Create new file" instead:
- Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
- Name it `index.html`
- Copy all content from `privacy-policy-template.html` and paste it in
- Click "Commit new file"

## Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click the **"Settings"** tab (top right of the repository page)

2. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar (under "Code and automation")

3. Under **"Source"**:
   - Select branch: **`main`**
   - Select folder: **`/ (root)`**

4. Click **"Save"**

5. Wait a few seconds - GitHub will show you the URL!

## Step 3: Get Your Privacy Policy URL

Your privacy policy will be available at:
```
https://AldoJr2005.github.io/17weeks-privacy/
```

(It might take 1-2 minutes for the page to be live after enabling Pages)

## Step 4: Use in App Store Connect

1. Copy the URL: `https://AldoJr2005.github.io/17weeks-privacy/`

2. Go to App Store Connect → Your App → App Information

3. Paste the URL in the **"Privacy Policy URL"** field

4. Save

---

**That's it!** ✅

The privacy policy will be live and accessible for TestFlight/App Store Connect.
