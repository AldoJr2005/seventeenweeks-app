# Starting a New App in Cursor

## Step 1: Create New Project Folder

1. **In Cursor, click "Open project"**
2. **Navigate to where you want the new app** (e.g., `~/Downloads` or `~/Desktop`)
3. **Create a new folder:**
   - Click "New Folder" button
   - Name it something like: `MyNewApp` or `AppName-Dev`
   - Open that folder

## Step 2: Share Figma Design

Once you have the folder open in Cursor:

1. **Share your Figma design:**
   - Option A: Share Figma link (make sure it's viewable)
   - Option B: Export screens from Figma and share images
   - Option C: Give me access to the Figma file

2. **Use the prompt template:**
   - Copy the template from `START_NEW_APP.txt`
   - Fill in your app details
   - Paste it here in our chat

## Step 3: I'll Set Up the Project

Once you share the Figma design and details, I'll:
1. Create the Expo/React Native project structure
2. Set up the folder structure
3. Implement the design
4. Configure for iOS/TestFlight
5. Set up backend if needed
