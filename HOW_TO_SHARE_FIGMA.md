# How to Share Figma Designs - Best Methods

## ✅ Method 1: Figma Share Link (BEST - Recommended)

**This is the easiest and best way:**

1. **In Figma:**
   - Open your design file
   - Click the **"Share"** button (top right)
   - Click **"Copy link"** or set permissions to **"Anyone with the link can view"**
   - Copy the link

2. **Share with me:**
   - Just paste the Figma link in our chat
   - I can view the design, inspect elements, see colors, spacing, etc.
   - I can see all screens and components

**Example link format:**
```
https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/YourAppName
```

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ I can see the full design
- ✅ I can inspect exact colors, fonts, spacing
- ✅ I can see all screens and components
- ✅ Easy to reference while coding
- ✅ No file uploads needed

## ✅ Method 2: Export Screens as Images (Good Alternative)

If you can't share the Figma link:

1. **In Figma:**
   - Select each screen/frame
   - Right-click → **"Export"** or use Export panel
   - Export as PNG or JPG
   - Export at 2x or 3x resolution (for clarity)

2. **Share with me:**
   - Upload images to a folder (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Share the folder link
   - Or describe which screens you're exporting

**What to export:**
- All main screens
- Key components
- Any design system/color palette
- Typography styles

## ✅ Method 3: Figma Dev Mode Link (If Available)

If you have Figma Dev Mode:

1. **In Figma:**
   - Open your file
   - Click **"Dev Mode"** (top right)
   - Share the Dev Mode link

2. **Benefits:**
   - I can see exact measurements
   - CSS/React Native code suggestions
   - Better for implementation details

## ✅ Method 4: Screenshots (Quick but Less Ideal)

If other methods don't work:

1. Take screenshots of each screen
2. Upload to an image hosting service
3. Share the links

**Note:** This is less ideal because:
- Lower quality
- Can't inspect exact values
- Harder to see spacing/colors accurately

## 📋 What I Need from Figma:

When sharing, it helps if you include:

1. **All screens:**
   - Login/Onboarding
   - Main screens
   - Settings
   - Any modals/popups

2. **Design tokens (if available):**
   - Colors (hex codes)
   - Typography (font sizes, weights)
   - Spacing system
   - Border radius values

3. **Components:**
   - Buttons
   - Cards
   - Input fields
   - Any reusable elements

4. **Notes:**
   - Any animations/interactions
   - Special behaviors
   - Any design decisions to note

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow:

**Best approach:**
1. Make Figma file viewable (Share → Anyone with link can view)
2. Copy the Figma link
3. Paste it in our chat with your app prompt
4. I'll review the design and implement it

**If you can't share the link:**
1. Export screens as high-res images (2x or 3x)
2. Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
3. Share the folder link
4. I'll work from the images

## 💡 Pro Tip:

**For best results:**
- Make sure the Figma file is organized (screens clearly labeled)
- Use consistent naming for frames/screens
- Group related screens together
- Add any notes/comments in Figma if needed

**The Figma share link is definitely the easiest and most effective method!** Just make sure it's set to "Anyone with the link can view" and paste it here. 🚀
