The PDF exports (Weekly + Full Summary) are incomplete and look unpolished. Fix the PDF generator so the PDF matches the app’s modern Apple-style UI AND includes weekly photos.

CURRENT PROBLEMS (must fix):
1) Text is clipping / nearly not visible in places and table layout breaks (overflow/wrapping issues).
2) “WEEK X PHOTO” sections do not embed the actual weekly photo image (it shows the section but no image).
3) The PDF looks like raw data instead of a designed report (no Apple-style layout).
4) Empty weeks (not logged) look messy with lots of “—” rows and broken spacing.

REQUIREMENTS (do ALL):
A) Use a proper layout system for PDF:
- Prefer HTML + CSS template -> PDF conversion OR react-pdf with a real component layout system.
- Use consistent margins, spacing, typography hierarchy.
- Ensure no text overlap or cutoffs. All tables must wrap/ellipsis gracefully.

B) Apple-style design:
- Cover page (for full report) with title, date range, and key totals.
- Use “card sections” with rounded containers, subtle dividers, lots of whitespace.
- Clean typography: big section headers, smaller labels, consistent alignment.
- Avoid dumping text. Make it scannable.

C) Weekly PDF layout (1 week):
Page 1:
- Header: Week X of 17 + date range
- Summary cards row:
  • Avg calories + macro targets (P/C/F)
  • Workouts count + breakdown
  • Habits summary (water days, avg steps, avg sleep)
  • Weekly weigh-in (weekly weight + weekly change + total change)
- A small, minimal chart (weight trend or calories trend) if feasible

Page 2:
- Weekly photo card:
  • Embed the actual photo for that week (from local FileSystem URI)
  • If missing, show a designed placeholder card “No photo uploaded”
- Daily details table:
  • Clean table with proper column widths and wrapping
  • Format sleep to 1 decimal (ex: 6.5) NOT long decimals like 6.5666667
  • Do not allow any row to split across pages
  • Use “—” only where necessary and keep it aligned

D) Full Summary PDF layout (all weeks):
- Cover page + final recap page (start weight, current/final weight, total change, goal weight, compliance)
- Each week gets its own section with:
  • Weekly overview cards
  • Weekly photo embedded (not just a header)
  • Daily table
- Add page numbers and consistent headers/footers
- For weeks with no data: show a clean “Week not logged” card and omit the giant empty daily table.

E) Image embedding (must work):
- Photos are stored locally via Expo FileSystem. The PDF export must:
  • Load the image file
  • Embed it in the PDF at a consistent size (crop/contain nicely)
  • Compress appropriately to keep PDF size reasonable

F) Output:
- Keep two export actions:
  • Download Weekly PDF
  • Download Full Summary PDF
- The exported PDF must look modern, aligned, readable, and consistent with the app UI.

DELIVERABLE:
Update the PDF generator implementation + templates so:
- No clipping/overflow
- Weekly photos are embedded
- Apple-style designed layout
- Clean empty-week handling
- Better number formatting (sleep rounded, etc.)
