Update/extend the existing Expo (React Native) app to add features 1–6 below. Keep the UI Apple-style: minimalist, modern, lots of whitespace, rounded cards, subtle dividers, smooth transitions, light/dark mode. iOS-first.

USE THIS STACK
- Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- Expo Router
- Expo SQLite for local data
- Expo SecureStore for password/PIN
- Expo Notifications where needed
- Expo Image Picker / Camera for photos

IMPORTANT RULE
The **challenge must start on a Monday** and users must not log anything before it begins (except setup/profile edits). Implement a clean “Pre-Challenge” experience.

========================
FEATURE 1) MONDAY START LOCK + COUNTDOWN SCREEN
========================
Requirement:
- When a user finishes account creation, compute the challenge start date:
  - If today is Monday and it’s already past the user’s chosen “start time” (or midnight), start immediately.
  - Otherwise set start date to the next Monday (00:00 local time) unless the user explicitly chooses a future Monday date.
- If it is NOT yet the start Monday, the app must show a dedicated locked screen:
  - Title: “Challenge Starts In”
  - Countdown timer: days / hours / minutes / seconds
  - Show start date (e.g., “Starts Monday, Jan 12, 2026”)
  - Show the user’s plan summary (calorie target, fasting window, workouts/week)
  - Only allow: “Edit Profile / Plan” and “Log out”
  - All logging tabs/screens must be disabled/blocked until countdown reaches zero.
Implementation:
- Add a “ChallengeStatus” check at app launch and before entering logging routes.
- If status = PRE_CHALLENGE, route to /pre-challenge and block navigation to other routes.

========================
FEATURE 2) BASELINE WEEK SNAPSHOT (Week 0)
========================
Before Week 1 starts, collect a simple baseline snapshot during onboarding (optional photo):
- Starting weight (required)
- Optional baseline photo (optional)
- Optional baseline habits:
  - Typical steps/day (rough number or range)
  - Current workouts/week
  - Typical daily calories estimate (optional)
Store as “BaselineSnapshot” linked to the challenge.
Display on the Pre-Challenge screen as “Your Baseline”.

========================
FEATURE 3) CALORIE DEFICIT CALCULATOR (SMART + VISUAL)
========================
Add an onboarding section: “Build Your Plan”.
Inputs:
- Height, current weight (from profile)
- Age and sex (needed for BMR/TDEE estimate)
- Activity level selector (Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, Very Active)
- Weekly weight loss goal slider with 3 labeled presets:
  - Conservative (e.g., 0.5 lb/week)
  - Moderate (e.g., 1.0 lb/week)
  - Aggressive (e.g., 1.5–2.0 lb/week)
- Goal weight (required)
Outputs (real-time UI):
- Estimated TDEE
- Recommended daily calorie target
- Estimated weekly loss based on deficit
- “Sustainability indicator” (text only): Sustainable / Challenging / Very aggressive
- Non-judgmental warning if calorie target is too low (set a safe minimum threshold and recommend adjusting)
UI:
- Apple-style segmented controls + slider + clean “Result cards”.
Data:
- Save the chosen plan into the Challenge table:
  - goalWeight
  - activityLevel
  - targetCalories
  - targetWeeklyLoss
  - deficitLevelLabel (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
Allow editing later in Settings (changes apply going forward, keep history if easy).

========================
FEATURE 4) WORKOUT PREFERENCE SETUP (NOT A FULL PROGRAM)
========================
Add onboarding questions that shape defaults and reminders:
- Workouts per week (0–7)
- Training style:
  - Gym, Running, Home workouts, Mixed
- Preferred split:
  - Push/Pull/Legs
  - Upper/Lower
  - Full Body
  - Cardio-focused
- Optional: “Do you also run?” yes/no + days/week
Use this to:
- Pre-build workout templates
- Set weekly workout expectation on Home dashboard (“Goal: 4 workouts this week”)
- Adjust reminder wording (e.g., include running days if selected)

========================
FEATURE 5) FASTING FEATURE (WINDOWS + SMART RECOMMENDATION)
========================
Add fasting setup during onboarding and in Settings:
- Choose fasting plan:
  - 16:8
  - 18:6
  - 20:4
(Also accept 14:10 if you want a softer option, but keep UI simple.)
Ask:
- “When do you normally eat lunch?” (time picker)
- “When do you normally finish dinner?” (time picker, optional)
App behavior:
- Recommend a fasting start time based on lunch time:
  - Example: if lunch is 12:00 PM and user chooses 16:8, recommend eating window roughly 12:00–8:00 PM, fasting 8:00 PM–12:00 PM
- Let user adjust start time manually.
UI:
- Show a clean horizontal 24-hour bar with:
  - Eating window highlighted
  - Fasting window muted
- Add daily fasting reminder options (optional): “Fasting starts at X” / “Eating window ends at X”
Data model:
- FastingPlan table or fields on Challenge:
  - fastingType (16_8, 18_6, 20_4)
  - eatingWindowStartTime
  - eatingWindowEndTime
  - fastingStartTime
  - fastingEndTime
Integrate into the Home dashboard with a small card: “Fasting: 16:8 • Window 12–8”.

========================
FEATURE 6) WEEKLY REFLECTION PROMPT (SIMPLE)
========================
Once per week (Sunday evening OR Monday morning), prompt the user with a clean card:
Questions:
- “What went well this week?”
- “What was hard?”
- “One thing to improve next week”
Keep it lightweight: 3 text fields (or 1 text area with prompts).
Store as WeeklyReflection linked to weekNumber.
Show reflections in the Week view and include them in PDF exports.

========================
APP FLOW CHANGES
========================
- Create profile/login (Name, Height, Weight, Password/PIN) as already planned.
- After profile creation:
  - Run onboarding: Baseline Snapshot + Plan Builder (calories) + Workout Preferences + Fasting Setup
  - Determine start Monday
  - If start date is in the future, route to Pre-Challenge Countdown screen and block all logging.
- At start time (Monday), automatically unlock the app and send the user to Home.

========================
DATA MODEL UPDATES (SQLite)
========================
Add tables/fields:
- UserProfile: name, heightValue, heightUnit, startWeight, weightUnit, age, sex
- Challenge: startDate, goalWeight, activityLevel, targetCalories, targetWeeklyLoss, workoutsPerWeek, trainingStyle, preferredSplit, runningDaysPerWeek, fastingType, eatingStartTime, eatingEndTime
- BaselineSnapshot: challengeId, baselineWeight, baselinePhotoUri(optional), typicalSteps(optional), workoutsPerWeek(optional), typicalCalories(optional)
- WeeklyReflection: challengeId, weekNumber, wentWell, wasHard, improveNextWeek, createdAt
- Add a simple “ChallengeStatus” computed field in logic (PRE_CHALLENGE / ACTIVE / COMPLETE)

========================
QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
========================
- Handle timezone correctly (America/Chicago).
- Pre-Challenge lock must be enforced at the router/navigation level (not just hidden buttons).
- Ensure all screens have polished empty/loading states.
- Keep UI consistent and minimalist.
- Provide a brief README note explaining how Monday start is calculated.

DELIVERABLE
- Working implementation of features 1–6 with polished UI and correct gating logic.
