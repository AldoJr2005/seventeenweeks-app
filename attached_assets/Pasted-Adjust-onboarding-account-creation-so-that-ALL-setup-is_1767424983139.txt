Adjust onboarding/account creation so that **ALL setup is completed before the challenge starts**. The goal is: when the user finishes creating an account, their full plan is ready, and when Monday arrives the app unlocks and they can start logging immediately with everything pre-configured.

WHAT I WANT (CORE FLOW)
1) User opens app → if no profile exists → show “Create Account”
2) Create Account collects:
   - Name
   - Height (ft/in or cm)
   - Current weight + unit (lbs/kg)
   - Age + sex (for TDEE)
   - Create password/PIN (required)
3) Immediately after account creation, run a guided onboarding wizard that gathers:
   - Goal weight (required)
   - Weekly weight loss goal selector (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive) with slider
   - Activity level selector → calculate TDEE + recommended daily calorie target
   - Workout plan preferences:
     • workouts per week (0–7)
     • training style (Gym / Running / Home / Mixed)
     • split preference (PPL / Upper-Lower / Full Body / Cardio-focused)
     • running days/week if chosen
   - Fasting setup:
     • fasting type (16:8 / 18:6 / 20:4)
     • ask typical lunch time (required)
     • optionally ask dinner finish time
     • recommend eating window + fasting start time based on lunch time
     • user can adjust
   - Baseline snapshot (Week 0):
     • baseline weight (prefill with current weight, allow edit)
     • optional baseline photo
     • optional rough baseline steps/day and workouts/week
   - Weekly reflection preference:
     • choose reminder day/time (default Sunday 8:30 PM)
4) After onboarding, compute challenge start date:
   - The challenge ALWAYS starts on the next Monday at 00:00 local time unless today is Monday and it’s before start time (or before midnight).
   - If today is not Monday, start date = next Monday 00:00.
5) If start date is in the future:
   - Route to a locked “Challenge Starts In” countdown screen.
   - The user cannot access logging screens/tabs until Monday.
   - The countdown screen shows plan summary (calorie target, workouts/week, fasting window).
   - Allow ONLY:
     • View plan summary
     • Edit profile/plan (re-run onboarding sections)
     • Log out / reset
6) When Monday arrives:
   - The app automatically unlocks.
   - User lands on Home dashboard with all defaults ready:
     • calorie target visible
     • workout templates pre-built
     • fasting window visible
     • reminders scheduled

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Use Expo Router route guards:
  - If profile not created → /auth/create
  - If profile exists but locked (password required) → /auth/unlock
  - If challengeStatus = PRE_CHALLENGE → /pre-challenge (block all other routes)
  - If ACTIVE → normal tabs enabled
- Store all onboarding answers in SQLite:
  - Challenge plan fields (goalWeight, targetCalories, activityLevel, workoutsPerWeek, split, fasting window times, etc.)
- Schedule notifications immediately after onboarding is complete:
  - If PRE_CHALLENGE, schedule notifications to begin on Monday (not before).
  - If ACTIVE, schedule immediately.
- Ensure the “Edit Plan” flow updates stored plan + re-schedules notifications.

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Apple-style wizard with progress indicator (Step 1 of N)
- Large inputs, segmented controls, sliders, time pickers
- “Plan Summary” screen at the end with an “All set for Monday” confirmation

DELIVERABLE
Update the app so account creation + onboarding collects ALL plan info up front, then locks the user in a pre-challenge countdown mode until Monday, and unlocks automatically with everything configured and ready to log.
