Extend the existing **Create Account / Onboarding wizard** to add TWO additional required steps:
1) Step Goal setup
2) Reminder Intensity preference

Do NOT change the rest of the onboarding flow. These steps must be part of account creation so the plan is fully configured BEFORE the Monday challenge starts.

========================
ADD TO MULTI-STEP SETUP
========================

INSERT NEW STEP — STEP GOAL SETUP
(Place this AFTER the Workout Plan step and BEFORE Fasting Setup)

Title: “Daily Step Goal”

Ask the user:
- “How many steps per day do you want to aim for?”

Options (segmented control or cards):
- 6,000 steps
- 8,000 steps
- 10,000 steps
- Custom (number input)

Rules:
- One option must be selected to continue
- Save as stepGoal in the Challenge/Preferences table
- This goal will be used ONLY for:
  • Habit completion logic
  • Weekly summaries
  • Compliance score
  • Insights
- Do NOT coach or nag beyond reminders

UI requirements:
- Apple-style cards
- Clear highlight on selected option
- Short helper text: “This helps track daily movement consistency”

========================
INSERT NEW STEP — REMINDER INTENSITY
========================
(Place this AFTER Fasting Setup and BEFORE Review & Finish)

Title: “Reminder Style”

Ask:
- “How strict should reminders be?”

Options (single selection):
- Gentle  
  • Fewer reminders  
  • Softer language  
  • No follow-ups
- Normal (default)
  • Standard reminders  
  • One follow-up if incomplete
- Strict
  • Firm wording  
  • Follow-up reminder if still incomplete

Rules:
- One option must be selected
- Save as reminderIntensity enum:
  GENTLE | NORMAL | STRICT

Use this preference to:
- Adjust reminder wording
- Control whether follow-up notifications are sent
- Control frequency (never spam)

UI requirements:
- Minimal explanation text
- Clean selectable cards
- Default to “Normal”

========================
DATA MODEL UPDATES
========================
Add fields:
- stepGoal (integer)
- reminderIntensity (enum)

Ensure these fields are:
- Saved during onboarding
- Displayed in the Plan Summary screen
- Editable later in Settings
- Used by reminder scheduling logic

========================
FINAL CONFIRMATION SCREEN UPDATE
========================
Update the “Review & Finish” screen to include:
- Step goal (e.g., “8,000 steps/day”)
- Reminder style (e.g., “Normal reminders”)

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
- Updated onboarding wizard with Step Goal and Reminder Intensity steps
- Values saved correctly
- Used in habits, reminders, compliance scoring
- Apple-style UI consistent with rest of the app
