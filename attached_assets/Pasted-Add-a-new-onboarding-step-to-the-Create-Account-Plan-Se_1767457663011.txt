Add a new onboarding step to the Create Account / Plan Setup wizard: **Macro & Nutrition Targets**.

GOAL
Based on the user’s selected calorie target (from the deficit calculator) + weight + workout plan, the app should **recommend daily macro targets** (protein/carbs/fat) with an Apple-style UI. The user can accept the recommendation or adjust it.

WHERE TO ADD
Insert this step **immediately after the Calorie Deficit Calculator step** and before the Workout Plan step.

STEP TITLE
“Macro Targets”

INPUTS (already collected in setup)
- Current weight + units
- Goal weight
- Age/sex/height
- Activity level
- Target calories/day (from deficit calculator)
- Workout plan preference (if not collected yet, use a default assumption and update once workout step is complete OR move this macro step after workout step. Prefer: after workout step if you need workout intensity.)

RECOMMENDATION LOGIC (simple + reasonable)
1) Protein:
- If workoutsPerWeek >= 3 (strength training): recommend ~0.8–1.0 g protein per lb of CURRENT body weight
- If workoutsPerWeek < 3: recommend ~0.7–0.8 g/lb
- Cap protein if calories too low so it stays realistic.
2) Fat:
- Recommend 20–30% of calories from fat (default 25%)
- Ensure a minimum fat floor (example: ~0.3 g/lb or a reasonable minimum) to avoid extremely low fat.
3) Carbs:
- Carbs = remaining calories after protein & fat
- Convert calories to grams (protein/carbs 4 cal/g, fat 9 cal/g)

PRESETS (UI toggle)
Provide 3 macro style presets the user can choose (single select):
- Balanced (default)
- Higher Protein
- Lower Carb
Each preset adjusts the macro split slightly while keeping total calories the same.
Show a live preview of grams and percentages.

UI REQUIREMENTS (Apple-style)
- Clean cards showing:
  - Target Calories
  - Protein grams/day
  - Carbs grams/day
  - Fat grams/day
- A segmented control for the preset (Balanced / Higher Protein / Lower Carb)
- A simple “macro rings” visual or bar chart (minimal)
- An “Adjust Manually” option:
  - sliders or stepper inputs for protein/fat
  - carbs auto-recalculates
- Validation:
  - macros must sum to target calories (within rounding tolerance)
  - show friendly warning if values are extreme (non-judgmental)

SAVE TO DB
Persist in Challenge/Plan:
- targetProteinGrams
- targetCarbsGrams
- targetFatGrams
- macroPreset (BALANCED / HIGH_PROTEIN / LOW_CARB / CUSTOM)

USE THROUGHOUT THE APP
- On Home dashboard show “Today’s targets: Calories + P/C/F”
- On Nutrition logging screen show targets as placeholders and a progress display (e.g., “Protein 110g / 160g” if user logs macros)
- Include targets and adherence in weekly summaries + PDF exports

DELIVERABLE
Implement the new onboarding “Macro Targets” step with the recommendation logic, polished UI, saved plan fields, and integration into Home + Nutrition log + exports.
