Build a **true native iOS app** using **Expo (React Native)** for a **17-Week Weight Loss Challenge**.  
This app is **iPhone-first**, single-user for now, but must be architected cleanly for future multi-user support.

PRIMARY GOAL
A private, Apple-style, minimalist iOS app that tracks:
• Weekly progress photos (every Monday)
• Daily calorie/macronutrient logging (manual totals from MyFitnessPal)
• Daily workout logging (Push / Pull / Legs / Plyo-Abs / Rest)
• Weekly weigh-ins + body measurements
• Daily habits (water, steps, sleep)
• Streaks, compliance score, and progress insights
• Smart reminders and notifications
• Photo comparisons and progress charts
• Final export/share summary at week 17

TECH STACK (USE EXACTLY THIS)
