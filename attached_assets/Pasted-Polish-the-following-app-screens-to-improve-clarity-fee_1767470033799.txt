Polish the following app screens to improve clarity, feedback, and Apple-style UX. 
Do NOT add new features beyond what’s listed. Focus on refinement, hierarchy, and intent.

========================
HOME (Daily Dashboard)
========================
1) Add a subtle personalized message under the date:
   - Rotate short neutral phrases weekly (examples):
     “Consistency over perfection.”
     “Keep the streak alive.”
     “One day at a time.”
2) When all daily checklist items are completed:
   - Replace “Pending” with a green “Completed” label
   - Add subtle haptic feedback
3) Keep layout minimal; do not overcrowd.

========================
NUTRITION LOG
========================
1) Display daily targets as context:
   - Calories input shows “Target: XXXX cal”
   - Protein/Carbs/Fat show target grams beneath inputs
2) After saving nutrition:
   - Show a small confirmation message:
     “Nutrition logged.”
   - Light haptic feedback
3) If calories exceed target:
   - Show neutral info text:
     “Above target by X cal”
   - Avoid red or warning language.

========================
WORKOUT LOG
========================
1) After saving a workout:
   - Show a brief confirmation:
     “Workout logged · Nice work.”
   - Add subtle haptic feedback
2) Keep workout selection fast; no extra prompts.

========================
PROGRESS → PHOTOS
========================
1) Replace empty timeline with a photo grid:
   - One card per week labeled “Week X”
   - If photo exists, show thumbnail
   - If missing, show a placeholder card with camera icon
2) Default Compare Photos view:
   - Week 1 vs Current Week
3) Keep navigation simple and clean.

========================
PROGRESS → INSIGHTS
========================
Convert insights from static facts to short interpretations:
- “You’ve logged 91 days of nutrition → Strong consistency.”
- “52 workouts completed → On track with your plan.”
- “13 of 14 photos taken → Great weekly adherence.”
- “22 lbs lost → Trending toward your goal.”

Rules:
- Neutral, encouraging tone
- No coaching or guilt language
- Keep insights short (1 line each)

========================
SETTINGS
========================
1) Group all plan-related items under a single “Plan” section:
   - Calories
   - Macros
   - Workout
   - Fasting
   - Steps
   - Sleep
2) Add a “Reset Plan” option:
   - Re-runs setup wizard
   - Does NOT delete historical data
3) Maintain clean spacing and avoid long scrolling blocks.

========================
GENERAL UI RULES
========================
- Apple-style hierarchy
- Subtle haptics only (no animations)
- No social, badges, or gamification
- Focus on calm, private, disciplined experience
