You are NOT implementing the signup correctly.

Right now “Create Account” only collects: name, height, weight, password.
That is WRONG for my spec.

I need “Create Account” to be a **multi-step onboarding wizard** that collects ALL plan info up-front, THEN routes to the **Countdown Dashboard** (pre-challenge lock screen) until Monday.

DO THIS:

========================
1) REPLACE CREATE ACCOUNT FLOW WITH A MULTI-STEP WIZARD
========================
When user taps “Create Account”, the flow MUST ask these in order (with Next/Back buttons and a step indicator like “Step 1 of 6”):

STEP 1 — Basic Info (required)
- Name
- Age (required)
- Height (required, ft/in or cm toggle)
- Current weight (required, lbs/kg toggle)
- Password/PIN (required) + confirm

STEP 2 — Goal
- Goal weight (required)
- Optional target date (optional) OR just keep “17-week challenge” and show pace options

STEP 3 — Calorie Deficit Calculator (required)
This screen MUST compute a recommended calorie target.
Inputs:
- Weekly weight loss goal (slider + presets):
  - Conservative (0.5 lb/week)
  - Moderate (1.0 lb/week)
  - Aggressive (1.5–2.0 lb/week)
- Activity level selector:
  Sedentary / Light / Moderate / Very Active
Outputs (live updating in UI cards):
- Estimated TDEE (use a standard BMR formula + activity multiplier)
- Recommended daily calorie target
- Small “Aggressiveness” label (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
- Non-judgmental warning if calories are too low (set a safe minimum)
User must tap “Use This Plan” to confirm target calories.

STEP 4 — Workout Plan (required)
Ask:
- Workouts per week (0–7) (required)
- Do you run? (yes/no)
  - If yes: running days/week (1–7)
- Preferred split:
  Push/Pull/Legs OR Upper/Lower OR Full Body OR Cardio-focused
Save these preferences to personalize defaults/reminders.

STEP 5 — Fasting Setup (required if fasting enabled)
Ask:
- Fasting type (choose one):
  16:8, 18:6, 20:4   (IMPORTANT: show as “16/8, 18/6, 20/4” if you want that UI)
- Typical lunch time (required time picker)
Then:
- Recommend fasting start/end automatically based on lunch time + fasting type
  Example: If lunch is 12:00 PM and 16:8 -> recommend eating window 12–8 PM
- Let user adjust start time manually
UI requirement:
- Show a clean 24-hour bar with eating window highlighted, fasting window muted.
- Save final fasting window.

STEP 6 — Review & Finish (required)
Show a clean “Plan Summary” screen:
- Start date (next Monday 00:00 local time)
- Goal weight
- Weekly loss goal label (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
- Target calories/day
- Workouts per week + split + running days
- Fasting type + eating window
Button: “Finish Setup”

After “Finish Setup”:
- Save everything to SQLite
- Store password securely (SecureStore)
- Schedule notifications to START on Monday (not before)
- Route to the “Challenge Starts In” COUNTDOWN DASHBOARD

========================
2) AFTER WIZARD, ALWAYS GO TO COUNTDOWN DASHBOARD (PRE-CHALLENGE LOCK)
========================
After signup + onboarding is complete:
- Send user to /pre-challenge countdown screen
- Block access to all tabs/screens except:
  - View plan summary
  - Edit plan (re-open wizard)
  - Log out/reset
No logging allowed until Monday.

========================
3) DATA MODEL MUST STORE THESE FIELDS (NOT JUST GOAL WEIGHT)
========================
Persist these (required):
- name, age, height, currentWeight, units
- goalWeight
- activityLevel
- weeklyLossGoal (value + label)
- tdeeEstimate
- targetCalories
- workoutsPerWeek
- doesRun, runningDaysPerWeek
- preferredSplit
- fastingType
- lunchTime
- eatingWindowStart, eatingWindowEnd (or fastingStart/fasingEnd)
- challengeStartDate (next Monday)

========================
4) UI REQUIREMENTS
========================
- Apple-style stepper wizard (progress indicator)
- Minimalist cards, segmented controls, sliders
- Clean review screen
- Validation: user cannot continue if required fields missing

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
Implement the above EXACTLY: multi-step Create Account wizard collecting all plan info, saving it, then routing to the countdown dashboard.
