I went through the full setup flow and the app is close, but there are **UI bugs and logic issues that must be fixed**, plus **missing data usage**. Please address ALL items below.

========================
1) FIX CONTINUE / NEXT BUTTON ISSUES
========================
- Some “Continue” buttons in the onboarding/setup flow do not advance correctly or require multiple taps.
- Review ALL onboarding steps and ensure:
  • Continue/Next buttons always work on first tap
  • Disabled/enabled states are correct
  • Required fields are validated before allowing continue
- Make sure keyboard focus or layout issues are not blocking taps (especially on iPhone).

========================
2) COUNTDOWN DASHBOARD IS USING WRONG DATA
========================
The countdown dashboard is currently showing incorrect values.

FIX THE FOLLOWING:
- It shows **goal weight = 165 lbs**, but my selected goal weight is **180 lbs**
- It says the challenge starts on **Tuesday**, but the challenge must ALWAYS start on **Monday**

REQUIREMENTS:
- The countdown dashboard must pull REAL values from onboarding setup, not defaults.
- Correctly calculate challenge start date:
  • Challenge start date = NEXT Monday at 00:00 local time
  • Never Tuesday
- Display on countdown dashboard:
  • Goal weight (from setup)
  • Target calories
  • Weekly weight loss pace (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive)
  • Workouts per week + split
  • Fasting type + eating window
  • Step goal
  • Reminder intensity
- Add a small label: “Plan ready – begins Monday”

========================
3) COUNTDOWN DASHBOARD = PLAN SUMMARY
========================
The countdown screen should act as a **read-only Plan Summary** until Monday.

Add:
- Clean Apple-style summary cards showing:
  • Calories/day
  • Macro targets (Protein / Carbs / Fat)
  • Workout frequency & split
  • Fasting window
  • Step goal
- No logging allowed
- Only actions allowed:
  • Edit Plan
  • Edit Profile
  • Log out

========================
4) ADD FULL PLAN EDITING IN SETTINGS
========================
Currently, once setup is done, the user cannot easily change their plan.

ADD SETTINGS SECTIONS:
- Edit Calories & Deficit
  • Change weekly loss pace
  • Recalculate calorie target
- Edit Macros
  • Adjust protein/fat (carbs auto-adjust)
- Edit Workout Plan
  • Workouts per week
  • Split
  • Running days
- Edit Fasting Plan
  • Fasting type (16:8 / 18:6 / 20:4)
  • Eating window times
- Edit Step Goal
- Edit Reminder Intensity

RULES:
- Changes should apply going forward (do not delete past logs)
- Recalculate dependent values automatically (e.g., macros if calories change)
- Re-schedule notifications after any change

========================
5) DATA CONSISTENCY FIX
========================
Ensure:
- All onboarding data is saved once and reused everywhere
- No hardcoded defaults override user input
- Countdown dashboard, Home, Settings, and PDF exports all reference the SAME stored plan data

========================
6) FINAL CHECK
========================
After fixes:
- Complete onboarding
- Verify countdown dashboard shows correct data
- Verify Monday start logic
- Verify settings edits persist and reflect immediately

DELIVERABLE:
- Fixed onboarding navigation
- Correct countdown dashboard data
- Editable plan in Settings
- Clean Apple-style UI consistency
