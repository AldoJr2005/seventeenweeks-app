# GitHub Pages Setup - You're Almost There!

You're on the Pages settings page! But first, let's make sure you've uploaded the file.

## Quick Check: Did You Upload the File?

1. **Click "Code" tab** (top of the repository page)
2. **Check if you see `index.html`** in the file list
   - If you see it → Great! Skip to "Enable Pages" below
   - If you DON'T see it → You need to upload the file first (see "Upload File First" below)

---

## If You Need to Upload the File First:

1. **Click "Code" tab** (top navigation)
2. **Click "Add file" button** → "Upload files"
3. Drag `privacy-policy-template.html` from `/Users/aj/Downloads/PWA-Builder/`
4. **Rename it to `index.html`** (in the filename field)
5. Click **"Commit changes"**
6. Then come back to Settings → Pages

## Enable GitHub Pages (You're Already Here!)

Since you're on the Pages settings page:

1. **Under "Build and deployment"** → **"Source"**:
   - Make sure **"Deploy from a branch"** is selected (it should be - it's the "Classic Pages experience")
   - If the dropdown is open, just click elsewhere to close it (it's already set correctly)

2. **Below that, you should see:**
   - **Branch dropdown:** Select **`main`**
   - **Folder dropdown:** Select **`/ (root)`**

3. Click **"Save"** button

4. **Wait a few seconds** - GitHub will show you a message with your URL:
   ```
   Your site is published at https://AldoJr2005.github.io/17weeks-privacy/
   ```

5. **Copy that URL** - that's your privacy policy URL for App Store Connect!

---

## If You Don't See Branch/Folder Options:

Make sure "Deploy from a branch" is selected (not "GitHub Actions"). The branch and folder options appear below when "Deploy from a branch" is selected.

---

**Once you see the URL, you're done with this step!** ✅
Then you can use that URL in App Store Connect.
