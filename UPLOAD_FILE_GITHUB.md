# How to Upload File to GitHub - Step by Step

## Method 1: Using "Add file" Button (Easiest)

1. **Look at the top of your repository page** - you should see a button that says **"Add file"**
   - It's usually next to a green "Code" button
   - If you don't see it, it might be a dropdown arrow - click it

2. **Click "Add file"** → Select **"Upload files"** from the dropdown

3. **Drag and drop** `privacy-policy-template.html` into the upload area
   - Or click "choose your files" to browse for it
   - File location: `/Users/aj/Downloads/PWA-Builder/privacy-policy-template.html`

4. **Rename the file:**
   - After uploading, you'll see the file name in a text field
   - Change it from `privacy-policy-template.html` to `index.html`

5. **Scroll down** and click the green **"Commit changes"** button
   - You can leave the commit message as is, or change it

## Method 2: Create New File (Alternative)

If you can't find "Upload files", you can create a new file:

1. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**

2. Name the file: `index.html`

3. Open `privacy-policy-template.html` on your computer (right-click → Open with TextEdit or any text editor)

4. **Copy ALL the content** from the file (Cmd+A, then Cmd+C)

5. **Paste it** into the GitHub file editor (Cmd+V)

6. Scroll down and click **"Commit new file"**

## What to Look For

- **"Add file"** button is usually:
  - In the top right area of the repository
  - Near the green "Code" button
  - Might have a small dropdown arrow next to it

If you still can't find it, try:
- Refreshing the page
- Looking for any button that says "Add" or has a "+" icon
- The repository might be in a special state - try clicking "Code" tab first, then look for "Add file"
