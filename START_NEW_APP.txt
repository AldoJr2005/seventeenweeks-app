I want to create a new iOS app. Here are the details:

**App Name:** [Your app name]
**App Description:** [Brief description of what the app does]

**Design:**
- I have the Figma design ready
- Figma file: [Link to Figma file or "I'll share it"]
- Design is complete: [Yes/No - any sections missing?]

**Technical Requirements:**
- Platform: iOS (may add Android later)
- Framework: Expo/React Native (like my previous apps)
- Target: TestFlight and App Store distribution
- Bundle ID: [Leave blank for me to suggest, or specify if you have one]
- App Category: [e.g., Health & Fitness, Productivity, Entertainment, etc.]

**Key Features:**
- [List main features, e.g., "User authentication", "Data tracking", "Photo uploads", etc.]
- [Any specific requirements or constraints]

**Backend/Database:**
- [Do you need a backend? Yes/No]
- [If yes: Simple backend with PostgreSQL (like previous apps)? Or different?]

**Notes:**
- [Any special requirements, existing accounts to use, etc.]

Please:
1. Review the Figma design
2. Implement it in Expo/React Native
3. Set up the project structure
4. Make it ready for TestFlight (proper bundle ID, signing, etc.)
5. Follow the same workflow as my previous iOS apps

Let me know if you need any additional information or clarifications about the design.
